title: "Is Your Laptop Freezing? Unstable Charging Might Be the Culprit!"
description: "Normally, connecting the AC adapter triggers a switch to high-performance mode, while unplugging reverts the system to battery-saving mode. However, unstable AC power can cause rapid, unintended toggling between these modes. This often manifests as sudden system lag or freezing."
